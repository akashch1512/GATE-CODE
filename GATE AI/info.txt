🧩 Tips to Stay Efficient:
🎯 One topic a day rule — e.g., today: BFS + practice + 1 video + 2 questions.

✍️ Make your own cheat-sheet after each topic (helps more than notes).

🧪 Try tiny simulations (draw trees, search steps, etc.) to make it stick.

💤 Don’t waste time on college definitions unless they're useful for understanding.
